# snakey
Been keen on the famous Snake game on your Nokia? Now it's here, after another thousand phototypes later

# Introduction
1. The game is POORLY CODED, so don't complain thanks
2. The snake will change its color when you reach a specific milestone, and I'm not telling you what it is jerky.

# Get Started
If you get this on, don't be confused about the background, I mean, who doesn't love Jiafei?

# Setup (as tested on MacOS)
1. Install Python 3 

2. Run make init (this will install pip packages, use virtualenv or something similar if you don't want to install globally)

3. Run make to run the game. Run DEBUG=True make to see rects and coords

# Demo
